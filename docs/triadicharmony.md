# Triadic Harmony Hypothesis: Intersections Between the Riemann Zeta Function, Bernoulli Numbers, and Pascal's Triangle

## Abstract

The "Triadic Harmony Hypothesis" aims to investigate potential intersections between three important mathematical constructs: the Riemann Zeta Function, Bernoulli Numbers, and Pascal's Triangle. While each of these constructs holds individual importance in the field of number theory, their interrelationships have been largely unexplored. This hypothesis does not seek to conclusively prove or disprove the Riemann Hypothesis, but rather to illuminate its intricate structure and deepen our understanding of prime numbers and non-trivial zeroes.

## Introduction

The Riemann Hypothesis, proposed by Bernhard Riemann in 1859, is one of the most significant unsolved problems in mathematics, with far-reaching implications across number theory, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics, among other fields. By probing potential interconnections between the Riemann Zeta Function, Bernoulli Numbers, and Pascal's Triangle, the Triadic Harmony Hypothesis aims to provide new perspectives on this enduring mathematical enigma.

## Interrelations in the Triad

Each element of the triad - the Riemann Zeta Function, Bernoulli Numbers, and Pascal's Triangle - has unique properties that are essential in the field of number theory. The Euler Product representation connects the Riemann Zeta Function with prime numbers. Bernoulli numbers exhibit a relationship with the sums of entries in rows of Pascal's Triangle. Pascal's Triangle encapsulates a delicate interplay between combinatorics and number theory. Unraveling these connections could provide new insights into the nature of prime numbers and non-trivial zeroes.

## The Riemann Zeta Function: Origin and Properties

The Riemann Zeta function, which is denoted as $\zeta(s)$, was first introduced by Bernhard Riemann in 1859. Its series representation is given by:

$$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}$$

A crucial property of this function is its continuation to the complex plane, apart from s = 1. The functional equation relating $\zeta(s)$ and $\zeta(1 - s)$ is given by:

| Description | Equation |
| :--- | :--- |
| The functional equation relating $\zeta(s)$ and $\zeta(1 - s)$ | $$\zeta(s) = 2^s \cdot \pi^{s-1} \cdot \sin(\frac{\pi s}{2}) \cdot \Gamma(1 - s) \cdot \zeta(1 - s)$$ |

This equation allows us to extend the Zeta function's definition to the whole complex plane, excluding the point s = 1.

## Interplay of Bernoulli Numbers with the Zeta Function

The Zeta function's values at negative integers are fascinatingly connected with Bernoulli numbers. This relationship is expressed as:

$$\zeta(1 - n) = -\frac{B_n}{n}$$ 

for n > 0. This links the Zeta function's behavior at negative integers to the structure of Bernoulli numbers, bridging different areas of mathematics.

## The Bernoulli-Pascal Connection

Bernoulli numbers also connect with Pascal's Triangle through the binomial theorem. The nth Bernoulli number ($B_n$) is related to the sum of entries in the nth row of Pascal's Triangle divided by $2^n$. This relationship serves as an intersection point between combinatorics (as represented by Pascal's Triangle) and number theory (as embodied by Bernoulli numbers).

## Riemann Hypothesis: A Triadic Approach

Our investigation now takes us back to the Riemann Hypothesis, which posits that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta function lie on the critical line of the complex plane, which is the line with real part 1/2. 

Prime numbers have a central role in this exploration. The Euler Product representation of the Zeta function brings these numbers into focus:

$$\zeta(s) = \Pi_{p} \frac{1}{1 - p^{-s}}$$

This formula shows the deep connection between the Riemann Zeta function and the prime numbers. Since prime numbers also connect with binomial coefficients that form Pascal's Triangle (through Lucas' theorem), there might exist a non-trivial connection among Pascal's Triangle, prime numbers, and the Zeta function.

In summary, the Triadic Harmony Hypothesis suggests that a careful investigation of the interconnections among the Riemann Zeta Function, Bernoulli Numbers, and Pascal's Triangle might help understand the Riemann Hypothesis.

## Conclusion

Although this investigation is in its preliminary stages, it marks a promising line of research that might offer novel perspectives on the Riemann Hypothesis. By uncovering potential interconnections among the Riemann Zeta Function, Bernoulli Numbers, and Pascal's Triangle, we may unearth insights about the nature of prime numbers and non-trivial zeroes. However, these initial findings must be substantiated through further rigorous mathematical exploration.
