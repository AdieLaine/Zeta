        This Python script uses Streamlit to visualize the behavior of the Riemann Zeta function, a complex-valued function that has important implications in number theory. The script includes the following features:

        Riemann Zeta Function Trajectory: This feature visualizes the trajectory of the Zeta function on the complex plane. It uses the plot_riemann_trajectory function to generate a plotly scatter plot, which represents the real and imaginary parts of the Zeta function values. The plot is colored according to the density of the points.

        Bernoulli Numbers and Pascal's Triangle: This feature shows the relationship between Bernoulli numbers and the coefficients of the binomial expansion, as illustrated by Pascal's Triangle. It uses the plot_pascal_bernoulli function to generate a matplotlib plot that shows the first 10 rows of Pascal's Triangle and the corresponding Bernoulli numbers.

        Zeta Function and Bernoulli Numbers: This feature shows the relationship between the Zeta function and the Bernoulli numbers. It uses the plot_zeta_bernoulli function to generate a plotly line plot of the Zeta function, with markers indicating the values at even positive integers and the corresponding Bernoulli numbers.

        The script is designed to be interactive, allowing the user to specify the number of points to be used in the Zeta function trajectory plot.

        The [Riemann Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis), one of the seven [Millennium Prize Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems), proposes that all non-trivial zeros of the [Riemann Zeta Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function) lie on the critical line in the complex plane, i.e., their real part is 0.5.

        **This application visualizes key properties of the Riemann Zeta function and related concepts that are central to understanding the Riemann Hypothesis:**

        - **Riemann Zeta Function Trajectory:** By visualizing the trajectory of the Zeta function on the complex plane, we can see where the function's values become zero. This can provide intuitive insight into the distribution of the zeros and their relationship to the critical line.

        - **Bernoulli Numbers and Pascal's Triangle:** The Bernoulli numbers are closely related to the values of the Zeta function at negative integers. This plot shows the connection between Bernoulli numbers and Pascal's Triangle, illustrating an important aspect of the function's behavior.

        - **Zeta Function and Bernoulli Numbers:** This plot shows the relationship between the Zeta function and the Bernoulli numbers. By seeing how these values correspond, we can better understand the properties of the Zeta function.

        Please note that the interactive nature of this application allows you to explore these concepts at your own pace and level of detail. This is not intended to be a comprehensive explanation of the Riemann Hypothesis, but rather a tool to help you explore the concepts that are central to understanding it.

        st.markdown(r"""
The Riemann Zeta Function, Bernoulli Numbers, and Pascal's Triangle form a remarkable triad that suggests deeper connections within number theory and mathematics as a whole. Let's take a closer look at the relationships that weave these three mathematical concepts together.

**Riemann Zeta Function**

The Riemann Zeta Function, $\zeta(s)$, is defined for complex numbers $s$ with real part greater than 0. Its definition is given by the series:

$$
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}
$$

For complex numbers $s$ with real part less than 1, it can be analytically continued via the functional equation relating $\zeta(s)$ and $\zeta(1-s)$.

**Bernoulli Numbers and the Riemann Zeta Function**

The Riemann Zeta function at negative integers is intimately related to Bernoulli numbers. More specifically, for $n > 0$, we have $\zeta(1-n) = -\frac{B_n}{n}$, where $B_n$ are the Bernoulli numbers. This relationship arises from the process of analytically continuing the Zeta function to the whole complex plane, excluding the point $s = 1$.

The Bernoulli numbers emerge naturally in the calculus of finite sums, and the Riemann Zeta function extends this to infinite series. Thus, this relationship effectively bridges finite and infinite realms in the context of sums of power series, providing a fascinating insight into how the concept of infinity can be tamed within the world of mathematics.

**Bernoulli Numbers and Pascal's Triangle**

Bernoulli numbers can be generated by a generating function, which is inherently connected to the binomial theorem. This connection provides a pathway linking Bernoulli numbers and Pascal's Triangle, the geometric representation of the coefficients in the binomial theorem.

Moreover, the $n$th Bernoulli number bears a relationship with the sum of entries in the $n$th row of Pascal's Triangle divided by $2^n$. This relationship subtly reveals the intricate interplay between combinatorics (as represented by Pascal's Triangle) and the algebraic properties of number theory (as embodied by Bernoulli numbers).

**Pascal's Triangle and the Riemann Zeta Function**

While a direct connection between Pascal's Triangle and the Riemann Zeta Function might not be immediately apparent, a deeper examination through the lens of combinatorial number theory could reveal potential links. One possible avenue is through the Euler Product representation of the Zeta function, which ties the Zeta function with prime numbers.

The prime numbers, in turn, have known, albeit complex, relationships with binomial coefficients that form Pascal's Triangle. For instance, the Lucas' theorem provides conditions for a binomial coefficient to be divisible by a prime number. This suggests that the coefficients of Pascal's Triangle, prime numbers, and the Zeta function might be interconnected in a non-trivial way.

In conclusion, the "Triadic Harmony" hypothesis proposes that the interconnections among the Riemann Zeta Function, Bernoulli Numbers, and Pascal's Triangle may serve as a fertile ground for deeper mathematical discoveries. Understanding these connections could shed new light on the mysterious Riemann Hypothesis and pave the way for novel insights in number theory. This exploration could be powered by the synergistic interplay of traditional mathematical investigation and innovative AI-based analysis tools.
